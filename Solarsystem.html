<p> The solar system is the space region where the Sun is at the center, and all the planets orbit around it. There are
eight planets, each with different sizes and features. Earth is the only known planet with life, Jupiter is the largest,
and Saturn is famous for its rings. Along with planets, there are moons, asteroids, and comets that also travel around
the Sun.</p>

Around it, eight planets move in their own paths, each one different. Mercury is hot and closest, Venus is covered in thick clouds, Earth is our home, and Mars is the red desert world. Farther out, Jupiter is the giant with powerful storms, Saturn has beautiful rings, and Uranus and Neptune are icy and far away. Along with these planets, there are moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets like Pluto, all traveling through space like one big cosmic family.</p>'
